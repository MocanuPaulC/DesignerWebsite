                    I used research techniques such as Trading Interview,
                    Personal Inventory Video and Semantic Differential.
                    The techniques I used were efficient and I was able
                    to get the information I was looking for. <br><br>
                    The research moment itself went smoothly and my user
                    understood the task she has to do. The data analysis
                    was a very complex process, where I had to put all the
                    information I gathered in place and find a connection between it.</p>

                    technique in my process of transforming
                    the raw data into insights.
                    An affinity diagram, sometimes also known
                    as a cluster map, is used to organize
                    information and is the output of affinity mapping.
                    Affinity diagrams help organize information
                    into groups of similar items—particularly
                    useful when analysing qualitative data or observations.
                    I used all the data cards and I clustered them
                    based on the information they provided.<br><br>
                    I observed that my user is a very people
                    related person and most of my data was
                    leading to that direction. One thing that
                    made me surprised was when I found out that
                    she is not a very tidy person
                    (she has a hard time cleaning) but still,
                    she likes all her things put in their
                    place(category) and she needs clear and
                    organized instructions.</p></td>

                <td colspan="2"><p>For this project I had to review the Procreate app.
                    I started by talking about the Usefulness with the be,
                    do and motor goals and then I moved on with the category
                    of users and the context in which the app will be used.
                    I rated the usability, engaging and meaning factors on a
                    scale from one to five, some of the factors were efficiency,
                    authenticity, flow and competence.
                    <br><br>
                    The colours of the background were chosen after I swatched
                    some of the Procreate logo’s colours using the Eye Drop Tool.
                    I noticed that their logo is mainly focused on the gradient
                    effect that starts with a white, very light yellow, goes through
                    shades of orange, green, blue, pink and ends with a dark purple.
                    Therefore, this logo made me think about the rainbow and in such,
                    I chose to use and place the colours on my canvas in the same order:
                    I started with white and a very light shade of yellow, and then,
                    like the rainbow’s colours, orange, green, blue and end it with pink.

            <tr>
                <td><p>Although the colour red is missing on their logo,
                    I wanted to include it in my design, so I used red to
                    write the title for the conclusion section. Moreover,
                    I consider that the dark shade of purple will be best
                    valued as a frame for the whole poster, so, as you can
                    see in the picture, it highlights and sharpens the entire design.
                    In the process picture I added below, you can observe how
                    I was trying to place the colours in different shapes and styles.
                    My focus was that I wanted to have enough space to write my
                    reviews but still make it look aesthetically pleasing and
                    unlike a basic row. The first tries were too messy, but after
                    some errors, the app’s logo came up again in my mind and inspired
                    me to design the “rows” alike that splash of colour present in
                    the logo itself.

                <td><p>Thus, you can see how the angles and the dynamics in
                    my row’s design matches the ones in the logo.
                    On each colour section I wrote chunks of text:
                    on the right, one below the other, I wrote my introduction,
                    the usability, engaging and meaning factors’ rating,
                    and on the left, the usefulness factors, the user group
                    and the context. The last pink “row” was left for the
                    conclusions and recommendations section and here I also
                    chose to insert an illustration of a girl that has on a
                    traditional easel a digital tablet. I felt that this drawing
                    illustrates very well both the society that is shifting now
                    from traditional to digital art and also, the app itself,
                    Procreate being an app used mainly for digital painting.</p></td>

                    I started by creating a mood board and a brainstorm about me
                    and the things I enjoy. As you can see i am a fan of fashion,
                    long trips and making memories with my friends. I am also inspired
                    by nature, plants, organic shapes and warm colours.
                    I love my furry friends and they play a very important role in my life.
                    Those are some things about me that I included in my moodboard.
                    I also included a colour palette made of my favourite colour shades.

                    “What defines me” question.

                    I value very much the time spent with my family,
                    but also I am an introvert person and I like to spend
                    quality time by myself, reading, painting or chilling in
                    nature. On top of that, I am friendly and spontaneous,
                    so I love to hang out, go to parties with my friends and
                    travel with them.</p></td>

                    consider the most valuable and create a paper low-fi wireframe.
                    I designed the first version of the app on paper in order
                    to be able to make quick changes and modifications before

                    page, I chose to keep a simplistic design and put just
                    my name and a minimalistic illustration of a girl that
                    is supposed to look like me. The colour brown was the
